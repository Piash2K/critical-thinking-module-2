## 🚀 About This Project

This repository contains **JavaScript implementations** for exercises in *Module 2: Critical Thinking*. The module focuses on developing analytical thinking, logical reasoning, and problem‑solving skills through coding challenges.

Each file — named `M02V0X.js` — corresponds to a specific exercise or assignment aimed at mastering core concepts through small, practical programs.

🧠 *Critical thinking in coding emphasizes understanding problems deeply and implementing clear, correct, and efficient logic.*
